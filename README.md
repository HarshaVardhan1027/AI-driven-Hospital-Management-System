🏥 AI-Driven Hospital Management System  

📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered hospital management system** designed to streamline healthcare operations.  
It helps manage **patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and resources** while integrating **machine learning models** to support decision-making in areas like patient flow, bed allocation, and treatment prioritization.  

✨ Features  
👩‍⚕️ **Patient Management** – Maintain digital patient records with medical history.  
📅 **Appointment Scheduling** – Optimize doctor-patient scheduling.  
🛏️ **Resource Allocation** – Smart allocation of beds, ICU units, and equipment.  
💳 **Billing & Reports** – Automated billing with detailed reports.  
🤖 **AI-Powered Insights** – Predict patient inflow, suggest optimal staff allocation, and identify resource bottlenecks.  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
**Language:** Python  
**Backend:** Flask / Django (optional, if web-based)  
**Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
**AI Models:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch  
**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

🚀 How It Works  
1. **Data Entry & Management** – Store patient and hospital data in a structured format.  
2. **AI Predictions** – Use ML models to predict patient inflow, treatment outcomes, or resource needs.  
3. **Smart Scheduling** – Allocate doctors, rooms, and beds based on priority & availability.  
4. **Dashboard** – Visualize hospital KPIs (bed usage, patient inflow, doctor workload).  

📊 Example Use Cases  
- Predict number of patients arriving in the emergency room.  
- Suggest optimal nurse-to-patient ratio for each shift.  
- Estimate bed occupancy for the next 7 days.  
- Alert for critical patient monitoring based on vitals.  

🔮 Future Scope  
- Integration with **IoT devices** for real-time patient monitoring.  
- **AI-powered diagnostics** (X-ray, MRI, ECG interpretation).  
- Blockchain-based secure health record management.  
- Deployment as a **cloud-based SaaS solution** for hospitals.
